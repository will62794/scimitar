# Scimitar

*Scimitar* is a tool for verifying the safety of distributed protocols based on the technique of *inductive proof decomposition*, a compositional approach for developing an inductive invariant in a way that aids automated synthesis and interpretability of the inductive proof. It was primarily developed for targeting safety verification of distributed protocols, but works for any TLA+ specifications accepted by TLC. Correctness of discovered invariants is formally verified using the [TLA+ proof system](https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html) (TLAPS).

## Setup

In order to run the tool you will need the following prerequisites:

- Java version >= 11
- Python 3 with pip installed
- Install Python dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that the scimitar tool makes use of a slightly modified version of the TLC model checker, whose source code can be found [here](https://github.com/will62794/tlaplus/tree/ce9e63ab5242a596b8dec15000b5ed5f97f63300). The binary of this modified version of TLC is included in this repo, so there is no need to download and build it manually.

## Example Usage

As a demonstration of using endive, you can run it on the [TwoPhase](benchmarks/TwoPhase.tla) benchmark, a TLA+ specification of the two-phase commit protocol. This will attempt to generate an inductive invariant for proving the [`TCConsistent`](https://github.com/will62794/endive/blob/master/benchmarks/TwoPhase.tla#L163-L168) safety property:

```bash
python3 scimitar.py --spec benchmarks/TwoPhase --seed 1 --num_simulate_traces 200000 --tlc_workers 6 --debug --target_sample_time_limit_ms 30000 --target_sample_states 200000 --opt_quant_minimize --k_cti_induction_depth 1 --ninvs 400000 --max_num_ctis_per_round 300 --save_dot --niters 5 --max_num_conjuncts_per_round 20 --num_ctigen_workers 7 --nrounds 45 --proof_tree_mode --auto_lemma_action_decomposition --enable_partitioned_state_caching  --cti_elimination_workers 1 --do_tlaps_induction_checks   --ninvs_per_iter_group 25000
```

As the tool runs, it dynamically synthesizes an inductive proof graph, which is a compositional way of representing an inductive invariant in terms of its lemma and action relative inductino dependencies. You can, for example, observe the graph as it is generated by opening `benchmarks/TwoPhase_ind-proof-tree-sd1.pdf`. An example of a completed proof graph for the `TwoPhase` protocol can be seen below:

This provides an intuitive way to understand the structure of the inductive invariant and proof, while also allowing for optimizations during synthesis.

When this run terminates, you should see output like the following, showing a candidate inductive invariant along with some other statistics about the run:

```

This generated inductive invariant is not necessarily a true inductive invariant, but one that endive reports as likely to be correct, based on probabilistic counterexample sampling.

In order to formally verify the correctness of this invariant, you will need to use TLAPS. You can see an example of a proof for an inductive invariant discovered by endive for the `TwoPhase` protocol benchmark [here](benchmarks/TwoPhase_IndProofs.tla). -->

## Creating a new benchmark

To create a new benchmark, you will need to define two files inside the `benchmarks` directory:

-  `<spec>.tla`:  a TLA+ specification of your protocol, with initial state and next state relation defined as `Init` and `Next`, respectively.
-  `<spec>.config.json`: A configuration file for running endive on your specification.

The configuration file is a JSON file with the following required, top-level fields:

- `preds`: a list of atomic TLA+ state predicates that define the grammar over which to search for candidate invariants to be used as conjuncts of an overall inductive invariant.
- `safety`: a string giving the TLA+ definition of the safety property to be verified.
- `constants`: a list of TLC configuration constant instantiations used for model checking the specification.
- `quant_inv`: a quantifier template that will be prepended to the candidate invariants generated from the atomic predicates given in `preds`
- `model_consts`: string giving a list of CONSTANT model values that are instantiated.
- `typeok`: definition of the TLA+ type invariant predicate to use during invariant inference (e.g. `TypeOK`).

Typically the easiest way to create a new benchmark configuration is to start from an example such as [`TwoPhase.config.json`](benchmarks/TwoPhase.config.json) (with corresponding TLA+ spec, [`TwoPhase.tla`](benchmarks/TwoPhase.tla)) and modify it as needed.
